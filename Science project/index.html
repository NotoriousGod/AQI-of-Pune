<h1>Pollution of Pune from past 5 years</h1>
<p> Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to pollution. Pune govt. is putting major efforts to decrease the pollution as soon as possible but nothing seems to work till now. The govt. alone will never be able to improve the air quality of Pune, But with the combined efforts of the citizens and the government we sure can fight air pollution.As night and day temperatures in the city continue to remain on the lower side, Puneâ€™s air quality index has deteriorated from satisfactory to moderate. The use of public transport needs to be promoted. The use of Metro rail can be encouraged by provision of an adequate number of feeder buses at Metro stations that ply with the desired frequency. More frequent checking of Pollution Under Control Certificates needs to be undertaken by the civic authorities to ensure that vehicles are emitting gases within permissible norms. People need to be educated to switch-off their vehicles when waiting at traffic intersections.</p>
